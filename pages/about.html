      <h1>About Our Team</h1>
      <p>TALOS Robotics Team is a student robotics team that specializes in participating in international robotics competitions, such as the First Lego League (FLL). FLL is an international robotics competition that challenges teams of students to design, build and program robots using Lego bricks. The competition includes a technical challenge, where teams must design and program robots to complete a series of tasks, and a project challenge, where teams must research and present a solution to a real-world problem.</p>
      <p>Our team is made up of 10 dynamic and dedicated members: Apostolos, Vasilis, Nefeli, Filippos, Konstantina, Michaela, Argyro, Petros, and Thodoris. Each member brings their own unique skills and expertise to the table, making our team a diverse and well-rounded group. In addition to our diverse backgrounds, we have also developed a great deal of experience in the field of robotics through our participation in the First Lego League. Over the past 5 years, we have achieved numerous successes, including first place prizes in the Thessaly region and awards at the panhellenic level. We have also had the opportunity to represent Greece in the Virtual Open International competition. Through our experiences in the First Lego League, we have cultivated a strong sense of teamwork and collaboration, as well as a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of robotics.</p>
      <p>Our team is always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the field of robotics, and we are excited to see what the future holds for TALOS Robotics Team.</p>
